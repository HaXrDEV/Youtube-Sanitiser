YouTube Sanitiser is a small Chrome extension that tidies up YouTube. It hides Shorts, playlists, mixes and, if you like, videos hardly anyone has watched, so your home page and sidebar are mostly the videos you actually came for.

## What it hides

Click the extension's icon in the toolbar and switch off whatever you don't want to see. Changes show up straight away in every open YouTube tab, and if you use Chrome sync, your settings follow you to your other computers.

- **Shorts.** The Shorts shelves on the home page and in search results, and Shorts in the sidebar next to a video.
- **Playlists.** Playlist cards in your feed, in search results and in the sidebar. They stay put on your You page, its playlists page and a channel's Playlists tab, since that's where you'd go looking for them.
- **Mixes.** The endless "Mix" playlists YouTube puts together for you. A mix you've saved still shows up on those same playlist pages.
- **Low view count.** Hides videos with fewer views than a number you choose (10,000 to start with). Turn on **Exclude subscribed channels** if you still want everything from the channels you follow, however small they are. To know who you follow, it reads your subscriptions from YouTube's sidebar, briefly opening its "Show more" list. The list is never saved or sent anywhere (see the [privacy policy](privacy-policy.md)).

Shorts, playlists and mixes are hidden from the moment you install it. The view count filter stays off until you turn it on.

The view count filter works in any language YouTube offers, without being told about it. It reads counts the way YouTube writes them in your language, and if YouTube uses an abbreviation your browser doesn't know, it learns it from YouTube itself. A video whose count it can't read yet is left alone.

## Installing

You load it into Chrome yourself:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and switch on **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and pick the repository folder.

If you change the code, click the reload button (↺) on the extension's card and refresh your YouTube tabs to see it. If you're curious how it finds and hides things, [docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md) walks through it.
